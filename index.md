### CPSC 120

* Lab 6

Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I learned how to use the "for" loop in the code and how the dashes and bars were printed out. I even accientdentlly put more work on my self by also printing the line number, dash count, and bar count with the rectangle. I also like the simplicity of the code to make the rectangle.

* Lab 10

Lab 10, part 3 was also one of my favorite labs because I learned how to print an image from a code line. In lab 10 was also the first lab that uses code on mutliple terminals which splits the work between the terminals. I also like the image of the gradient image because of the slow transition between colors.

* Lab 12

Lab 12, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I learned how to write any message on and TV static background. I also learned about one use for the prng in code. I liked how the background look because it looks chaotic and random when the prng is not really random.

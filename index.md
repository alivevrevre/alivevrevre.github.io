### CPSC 120

* Lab 6
Lab 6, part 1 was one of my favorite labs because I learned how to use the "for" loop in the code and how the dashes and bars were printed out. I even accientdentlly put more work on my self by also printing the line number, dash count, and bar count with the rectangle.

* Lab 10
Lab 10, part 3 was also one of my favorite labs because I learned how to print an image from a code line. I also like the image of the gradient image because of the slow transition between colors.

* Lab 12
Lab 12, part 2 was one of my favorite labs because I learned how to write any message on and TV static background. Also, it shows that my skills have grown since the beginning of the school year.
